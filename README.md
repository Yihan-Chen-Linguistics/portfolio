# Work Experience

## Post-Doctoral Researcher | Bilingualism, Language, and Brain Lab, University of Florida        2024 â€“ now
- Conducted a research project evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art ASR models (e.g., *Whisper*, *Wav2Vec*) on elderly speech, identifying key limitations in handling unique acoustic features.
- Analyzed word error rates (WERs) by comparing ASR-generated texts with human annotations and pinpointed critical areas where large ASRs underperformed.
- Developed comprehensive guidelines to improve human annotation accuracy, driving advancements toward more reliable ASR systems for elderly speech.
- Mentored and trained 10+ undergraduate students, fostering research skills, academic growth, and contributions to cutting-edge ASR projects.

## Lead Researcher | Bilingualism, Language, and Brain Lab, University of Florida        2019 - 2024
- Led and managed 3 complex research projects, overseeing all stages from design to execution.
- Designed linguistic stimuli by extracting over 1,000 items from a multimillion-word corpus using Python (*Unicode* and *Regular Expressions*).
- Processed and matched linguistic items based on semantic similarity using *FastText* and *Word2Vec* embeddings, with results evaluated against human performance benchmarks.
- Conducted data collection for 200+ participants using online surveys, cognitive tests, and neuroimaging methods, ensuring high data quality across all stages.
- Performed advanced statistical analyses using regression models and mixed-effects models in R to investigate how specific linguistic features affect bilingual language processing.
- Compiled and presented findings through detailed research reports featuring complex data visualizations (using *tidyverse* and *ggplot* in R) and summaries in PowerPoint.
- Presented report to a panel of 4 experts (including one computational linguist and one native Chinese speaker) and fielded questions from technical and non-technical audiences during a 2-hour defense, resulting in a doctorate degree and publication of a dissertation. 

## Core Researcher| Language Documentation team, Australian National University        2016 - 2018 
- Conducted structured and semi-structured interviews with 1 or 2 native Wiru speakers weekly. 
- Adapted interview questions based on participant responses to explore emerging themes.
- Recorded, transcribed, and analyzed interview data of 2000+ words, 500+ sentences, 10+ stories.
- Identified patterns in language use and cultural narratives.
